//! Mouse input support (planned feature).
//!
//! This module is reserved for future mouse input functionality. The MinUI framework
//! is designed with mouse support in mind, but the current implementation focuses on
//! keyboard input.
//!
//! ## Planned Features
//!
//! - **Mouse Movement**: Track cursor position within the terminal
//! - **Click Events**: Handle left, right, and middle mouse button clicks
//! - **Drag Operations**: Support for drag-and-drop interactions
//! - **Scroll Events**: Mouse wheel scrolling support
//! - **Hover Detection**: Mouse hover events for UI elements
//!
//! ## Future API Design
//!
//! The mouse handler will likely follow a similar pattern to the keyboard handler:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use minui::input::{MouseHandler, MouseEvent};
//!
//! let mouse = MouseHandler::new();
//!
//! // Poll for mouse events
//! if let Some(event) = mouse.poll()? {
//!     match event {
//!         MouseEvent::Click { x, y, button } => {
//!             println!("Clicked at ({}, {}) with {:?}", x, y, button);
//!         },
//!         MouseEvent::Move { x, y } => {
//!             println!("Mouse moved to ({}, {})", x, y);
//!         },
//!         MouseEvent::Scroll { direction } => {
//!             println!("Scrolled {:?}", direction);
//!         },
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation Status
//!
//! Mouse support is not yet implemented but is planned for a future release.
//! The current focus is on providing robust keyboard input and core widget functionality.

// TODO: Implement mouse input support
// This will include mouse movement, clicks, drags, and scroll events
